To build the requested website I used Vue.js framework. 
It works great when building dynamic user interfaces and helps a lot with making applications ready to be further developed in the future.
Vue offers detailed documentation and the community is eager to share it's knowledge with others. 
While planning bigger project it's a good idea to decide to work with Vue CLI (command-line interface). 
It offers creating basic project with packets ready-to-use. 
Usually setting up the project and configuring it may take many hours, but thanks to Vue CLI, it takes just a while.
Although I use Gulp when working with smaller projects, the effectiveness of my work made me choose Vue CLI with configured webpack.
When moving the project from development mode to production, 
Webpack and Babel minify files, compile the code and transpile it to work with older browsers automatically. 
To style the webpage I used Sass preprocessor. 
In the past I worked with both Sass and Less, and even though I don't feel any major difference between them, I prefer to use Sass.
